# Description
The code in this repository is a series of test harnesses used to build a smart trap activation device. The code includes the test harness for transmissitng the data from the smart trap device (reed switch connected to tiny ESP 32) to a google sheet where it is then displayed on a NZ map to show where the trap had been activated. This allows the rangers responsible for the trap to go on site and reset the trap as quickly as possible.
